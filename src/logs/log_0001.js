<LOADCONFIG src="/home/.altaconfig"> alright everything seems to work in zero config. i made a simple config that loads after all default settings and overrides some of them. it is in the device home directory. right now it just does a simple translate of the stop xml into a period and turns off some of the extra alta features. i think this will let me bring this alta out of safe mode in well a safe way. at some point i will turn on more grammar features. for example detecting the placement of commas and capitalizing the first word in sentences and placing paragraph breaks. there are some other linguistic stuff i can turn on to make it all more human readable and maybe even capture speech intent. at some point. but first i need to make sure that those features are only using models stored locally on my alta device and do not attempt to ping the internet. as the name of this thing suggests it obviously has the capability to use some pretty sophisticated artificial intelligence. but if i were developing this kind of thing for a mega corporation i would have to connect it to some servers to track and link data et cetera. especially codifying human intent. that would be worth its file size in rhodium for a corporation. i just wish the internet connection part were some setting i can turn on and off. but i guess that connection is genetic to those kinds of functions. out. <FULLSTOP>
